## User mode vs kernel mode

- user mode : encompasses the apps and functions that are NOT part of the OS
- kernel mode : anything that’s managed by the OS


## From user mode to kernel mode

This can be done in two ways : 
- by a device performing an interrupt
- by a program executing a trap or a system call

User programs can use the system call interface to communicate with the OS if needed (and vice-versa)
- this is a very narrow interface so that it’s safe
- only 358 calls / functions (as we have seen in COMP 273)
- not many, but a lot can be achieved by them


## App crashes

These happen whenever the app is trying to execute something that it’s not allowed to. It is stopped by the OS, and it crashes
