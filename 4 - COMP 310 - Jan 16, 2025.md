## Single process systems

A process (according to the OS) does two things : 

1. it computes (using the CPU)
    
2. it’s doing I/O (while using the device, the CPU isn’t active)
    


This may cause problems when we’re doing two processes, since there are periods where the CPU is idle

- this is NOT ideal

## Multiprocess Systems

Multiprocess systems fix this by alternating between processes once we feel that the CPU is idle (when one process is doing I/O)

- there is still a small interval of time that’s wasted (for the CPU to go to the other process) BUT it’s considerably less than with single process systems

### What to do when P2 finishes?

we use a method called “process scheduling” to find this out, it always depends

## Process switch

This is the switch done whenever the CPU changes the process it’s working on

- keep enough information about the previous process so that we can restore it later and keep going


### Implementation

process : 

- code 
- stack
- heap
- registers
- MMU info
	- resides in the shared locations (ignore for now)


### Process control block - PCB

> [!Important] 
> The **KEY data structure** in this class

the process control block is saved in RAM and contains : 

- **process identifier – pid** (unique id)
- **process state** 
	- only update when the process is NOT runninng
- space to support the process switch (save area!)

The PCB array is where PCBs are stored, and they’re **indexed by hash(pid)**

P1 → P2 : 
- save registers(P1) → PCB[P1].SaveArea
- restore PCB[P2].SaveArea → registers


We have to be very careful when implementing this in Assembly. 

- could push a register in the stack to get a free space
- but even this can be tricky as we might overwrite something already in the stack
  

We also have to save and restore a lot of things, not just registers, also MMU information


## Process scheduling

This is necessary when we go from READY → RUNNING

Think of the scheduler as managing a queue (ish)

- process ready : enqueue()
- according to scheduling policy
- scheduling decision : dequeue()
- But it’s not always implemented this way


### Interrupts

Infinite loops might break your computer because there would be no way to stop it.

- this is why we use interrupts 

Interrupts are like timers that interrupt the process whenever it reaches a certain number

- the CPU can decide to ignore it or interrupt the process completely


### Preemptive vs. non-preemptive schedulers

- <mark style="background: #5698FF9E;">preemptive</mark> : process may be forced off the CPU
	- process can be thrown out at any time 
	- sometimes not a problem, but it may become one (if it SEEMS unresponsive but it isn’t really)

- <mark style="background: #5698FF9E;">non-preemptive</mark> : the process only voluntarily relinquishes the CPU
	- can monopolize the CPU
	- only useful in certain circumstances


Almost all devices use preemptive schedulers
- non-preemptive are only useful if we trust EVERY program we might run


### Implementation

We have to : 

- remember the running process
    
- maintain sets of queues
    

- CPU ready queue
    
- I/O device queue (one per device)
    

- PCBs sit in the queues
    

  

1. The scheduler runs when : 
	- process starts or terminates (syscall)
	- running process performs an I/O (syscall)
	- I/O completes (I/O interrupt)
	- timer expires (timer interrupt)

2. the scheduler runs and decides on process to run

3. switches to a new process

4. starts a new timer (for interrupts)
  
### Good or bad scheduling algorithm?

Good : 

- minimizes response time
    
- wait from ready → running
    
- schedule interactive jobs quickly so that the users see the output quickly
    
- minimize turnaround time
    
- not wait long for job to complete
    
- minimize waiting time
    
- not spend long on “wait” queue
    
- maximize throughput
    
- many jobs per unit of time
    
- maximize resource utilization
    
- keep expensive devices busy
    
- minimize overhead
    
- reduces number of context switches
    
- maximize fairness
    
- all jobs get the same amount of CPU over some time interval


BUT “goodness” depends on what we want to run, but the scheduler doesn’t know this in advance

  

### Interactive jobs

the user is waiting for the result
- tend to be short

Here, we care about minimizing the response time


### Batch jobs

the user looks at the result later
- tend to be long (runs for a while)

Here, we care about low overhead and high throughput
  

### Response time vs. throughput

- these goals are conflicting
    

  

Throughput : runs scheduler as little as possible

Response time : runs scheduler OFTEN

  
  

## First come first served - FCFS

This is a **non-preemptive method**
  
### Pros and cons
- few scheduling events
- good throughputs
- uneven response time (stuck behind a long job) 
- process can monopolize the CPU (worst case)


## Shortest job first - SJF

This inserts in queue according to the process length (head = shortest)

- can be either preemptive or non-preemptive (**consider only preemptive**)
- BUT it’s impossible to find out exactly how long a process takes to run


### Pros and cons
- good response time for short jobs
- can lead starvation for long jobs
- difficult to predict job length


## Round Robin (RR)

Define some amount of time (called “quantum”) – usually very short

- Process ready : put tail of queue
- Head of queue : run for “quantum” amount of time
- After quantum : put running process at the tail of the queue + reschedule

Evenly distributes the processes AND acts like FCFS

We can see how long a process takes to run by measuring how many quantums it takes to run fully

### Choosing quantum length

too short : 
- many scheduling events
- good response time
- low throughput

too long : 
- few scheduling events
- bad response time
- good throughput

normal length : ~10 milliseconds
