## Condition variables

They’re used whenever thread A needs to wait for a certain event to be completed by thread B

- A would be sleeping here, and it wastes CPU time (CPU isn’t busy)

  

### Example (incorrect)

(lec 3, slide 81)

- assuming f gives a result x such that the condition is true

  

Possible outcomes : 

1. if thread B runs first, then thread A will always be waiting ( signal() happens before wait())
    
2. if thread A is called, then thread B changes x’s variable and sends the signal
    

- the if statement in thread A is never reached again (???) and misses the signal from thread B
    

  

We have a data race with the shared variable being the condition variable (not only x)

- Every time we use a condition variable, we need to use a mutex to prevent a data race

### Correct interface

All 4 functions have to be called to avoid data races (lec 3 slide 89) : 

- `phtread_cond_init(*cv, *cattr)` : initializes the conditional variable
    
- `pthread_cond_wait(*cv,*mutex) `: blocks thread until the condition is true
    
- `pthread_cond_signal(*cv)` : unblock one thread at random that is blocked by the conditional variable
    
- `pthread_cond_broadcast(*cv) `: unblock all threads that are blocked on the conditional variable pointed to by cv

- starts with the thread on the right, and then when shared_data is not 0, then we wait and go to the thread on the left
    
- prints out the numbers
    
- signals and then finishes the code on the right code


## Semaphore

A shared, non-negative counter. Implement with `#include <semaphore.h>`
- We can initialize it to whichever non-negative value we want (like 0)

Two primary operations : 
- `wait` :  attempts to decrement the counter (if it reaches 0, then it blocks, waits for the semaphore)
- `post` / `signal` : attempts to increment the counter (if it’s 0 before increasing, then after increasing, we unblock the semaphore)
- these changes are **ATOMIC**!

### Different uses

Mutual exclusion :
- A semaphore is being used as a lock when it’s initialized to 1

Bound the concurrency : 
- Only allow X threads out of N to proceed
  
### Semaphore interface

- `int sem_init()`
- `int sem_post()`
- `int sem_wait()`

There’s a way to share semaphores between processes → unusual

## Monitors

A collection of variables and functions (kinda like objects in Java)

- threads can only access monitor functions – yet variables are private to the monitor


Con : only one process at a time can use a function inside a monitor

  
  

## Synchronization

How are locks, semaphores, etc. implemented?

  

## Milk problem (Alice and Bob)

Two important terms for synchronization problems : 
- Safety : never more than one person buys
- Liveness : someone buys if needed


### Lock implementation

Use a note to avoid buying an extra carton of milk, remove the note if someone bought it
- this would be an atomic, but we could still have synchronization issues
