# Picking a page / frame to replace
There are different replacement policies : 
1. Random -> terrible
2. FIFO
3. OPT
4. LRU

It's important to have a good page replacement policy because it could save a lot of time : 

- Normal memory access : ~ nanoseconds
- Faulting memory access : 
	- Disk I/O : ~ 10 milliseconds
	- which is ~ 1 000 000 times slower!
		- too many page faults -> program is VERY slow

# Page replacement policies 

## Random
A random page is replaced

- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Pro</mark> : Easy to implement 
- <mark style="background: #FF373791;">Con</mark> : Doesn't take advantage of spatial/temporal locality
	- assumes all pages are used uniformly --> not true


## FIFO
Oldest page is replaces 
- Age = time since it was brought to memory

- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Pros</mark> : 
	- easy to implement 
		- using a queue of page
	- fair
		- all pages receive equal residency 

- <mark style="background: #FF373791;">Con</mark> : 
	- doesn't take into account "hot" pages that may always be needed
	- on average, it's a bad policy (ratio)


### Quiz 
Counting page faults (not counting the first time we fill the queue) :

- 12 page faults!
- 17 references, and 12 page faults --> terrible


## OPT
Replace the page that will be referenced the furthest in the future
- we only care about the NEXT time the page is referenced

- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Pros</mark> : the most optimal policy
	- we care about the **temporal locality** of the page!

- <mark style="background: #FF373791;">Con</mark> : cannot be truly implemented without knowing the future (impossible)

### Quiz
Counting page faults (not counting the first time we fill the queue) : 

![[Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 10.34.25 AM.webp]]

- **6 page faults!** 
	- this is the minimal number of page faults for this reference string, no matter the policy we pick


## LRU (Least Recently Used)
We cannot see the reference string in the future, but we can use the past to ~ predict it.

- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Pros</mark> : with locality, LRU approximates OPT

- <mark style="background: #FF373791;">Cons</mark> : 
	- harder AND EXPENSIVE to implement exactly
	- doesn't handle all workloads well
		- <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">ex</mark> : large array scans that repeat

### Quiz
Counting page faults (not counting the first time we fill the queue) : 

![[Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 10.48.04 AM.webp]]

- **9 page faults!**

### Problem
Since it's too expensive (need to timestamp every reference), we prefer approximating it


## LRU approximation with hardware

we use hardware support by using a **reference bit**!
- bit in page table --> <mark style="background: #5698FF9E;">access bit</mark>
- hardware sets bit when the page is referenced

Periodically
- read out and store all the reference bits
- reset all the reference bits to 0

Keep all reference bits for some time (newest bit == most significant)
- the more bits kept, the better the approximation

Replacement : 
- Happens to the page with the **smallest value of the reference bit** history

# Exercise 
Consider a memory with 5 pages.  
1. Generate **worst-case** address reference streams for **FIFO** and **LRU**. Worst-case reference streams cause the most misses possible.  
2. Compare with **OPT** in all scenarios from point 1.  
3. For the worst case reference streams, how much bigger of a cache is needed to improve performance dramatically and approach OPT?

**For both FIFO and LRU :** 
0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 ...
- worst possible ratio (1)
- least number of pages

**Using OPT :** 
![[Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 11.13.36 AM.webp]]

- for every 5 accesses, we get 1 page fault ==> **ratio of 0.2**

For the worst case reference streams, how much bigger of a physical memory (frame) is needed to improve performance dramatically and approach OPT?  
- we only need one more frame!

# Bélády's Paradox
If the number of frames increases, then is it guaranteed that the number of faults decreases?

- For OPT
	- cannot get bigger
- For LRU
	- idem
- For FIFO
	- no, it could increase
	- there's no limit to how worse the number of faults can increase
