## Creating `foo/bar`

![[Screenshot 2025-03-20 at 11.24.23 AM.webp]]

*Note :* We assume that `foo` already exists

Last step : 
- we did a **write** to `foo` and didn't update its metadata
	- we need to fix it! --> write to `foo inode`

*Note :* every single one of these steps accesses the disk --> <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">this is VERY slow</mark>


## Open `foo/bar`

## Write to `foo/bar`

*Note :* assume that :
- the file already exists and that it's already been opened
- the block is full, so we have to allocate a new one

the `write` for `bar inode` is overwriting the metadata

## Efficiency

This isn't really efficient, since the head moves between directories, inodes, and data.
- we need to avoid this!

We can try to access the in-memory data structures...

---

# In-memory data structures

## Cache
- Fixed contiguous area of kernel memory
- <mark style="background: #FF7DC391;">size = max number of cache blocks * block size</mark>
- a large chunk of memory of the machine

- In general, we use write-behind as seen in [[18 - COMP 310 - Mar 13, 2025|lecture 18]]
- for **user data** : ok
- for **metadata** :
	- written to disk more aggressively
	- affects the integrity of the file system


## Cache directory
- Usually a **hash table** so we can find where things are in the cache
- <mark style="background: #FF7DC391;">index = hash(disk address)</mark>
- the cache directory has an overflow list in case of collision
- usually has a "dirty" bit
	- indicates if the corresponding block in the cache has been modified since it was read
	- if it's <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">NOT dirty, we don't need to write it to the disk</mark>

### Cache replacement
- keep an LRU list
	- unlike memory management, here it's easy to do 
	- accesses are far fewer compared to file vs memory access

- if no more free entries in the cache : 
	- replace "clean" block according to LRU
	- replace "dirty" block according to LRU

### Cache flush
- find everything in the cache that's dirty and write it to the disk
	- do this periodically (~30 seconds) OR when the disk is idle


## (System-wide) active file table
- one **array per entire system**
- one **entry per open file**
	- each entry contains : 
		- file inode
		- additional information (ie. reference count of number of file opens)

## (Per-process) open file tables
- one **array per process**
- one **entry per file open** of that process
	- indexed by file descriptor <mark style="background: #007DFF61;">fd</mark>
	- each entry contains : 
		- pointer to file inode in active file table
		- file pointer fp
		- additional information

# Processes using in-memory data structures

- except for the first time accessing the file, the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">cache is getting rid of ALL disk accesses</mark>! 
	- this is much more time-efficient

# Practice problem (slide 135 - lec 11)

## Problem description 
1. Process P1 opens file A and reads 512 bytes from it.
2. Process P2 opens file A and reads 1024 bytes from it.  
3. Process P3 creates file B opens it and writes 8192 bytes to it.  
4. Process P1 opens file B and reads 1024 bytes from it.  

At the end of this sequence of operations, describe the contents of the file system’s in-memory data structures, including the active file table, open file tables, and cache. 
You can assume that, prior to this sequence of operations, the file A existed and had <mark style="background: #FF7DC391;">length 4096 bytes</mark>, and all in-memory data structures were empty. The size of the entries in the cache is <mark style="background: #FF7DC391;">1024 bytes</mark> and the cache has <mark style="background: #FF7DC391;">8 entries</mark>. 

<mark style="background: #FF000063;">Nothing else is happening in the OS during this sequence of operations.</mark>  
- if this weren't the case, then we cannot determine how the cache is behaving

*Cache replacement policy:* 
- first kick out data chunks (LRU), 
- followed by bitmaps (LRU if more than one bitmap), 
- followed by inodes (LRU, if more than one inode)

## Solving it

1. *Process P1 opens file A and reads 512 bytes from it.*
![[Screenshot 2025-03-25 at 10.55.31 AM.webp]]

- we have to read the whole entry even though P1 only wanted the first 512 bytes


2. *Process P2 opens file A and reads 1024 bytes from it*
![[Screenshot 2025-03-25 at 10.56.38 AM.webp|720]]

- the full KB from file A is already cached, so there's no need to access the disk


2. *Process P3 creates file B opens it and writes 8192 bytes to it.*
![[Screenshot 2025-03-25 at 10.57.15 AM.webp]]

- creating a new file --> creating a new inode
	- bitmap inode is now in the cache
- creating the inode --> keep the new inode B in the cache
- writing to file B --> keep the data bitmap
- we only have space for 3 KB in the cache
	- evict the LRU chunks based on the *cache replacement policy* stated above

4. *Process P1 opens file B and reads 1024 bytes from it.*

# Setting up the file system (FS)

By default, the OS sees all storage devices as chunks of unusable, unallocated space
- cannot start writing files to a blank drive!
- we need to set up the FS first :

## Disk partitioning / Slicing
FS needs a "**container**" on the storage device
- the **container** is called a <mark style="background: #007DFF61;">partition</mark>
- partitioning allows different FS to be installed on the same OS

Each partition appears to the OS as a logical disk (virtual disk)

The disk stores partition information in a <mark style="background: #007DFF61;">partition table</mark> and it HAS to be in the first block
- partition locations
- partition sizes

The OS reads the **partition** **table** before any other part of the disk

## Mounting a file system (FS)
The FS lives inside a partition, but the OS cannot read/write files yet

- The FS needs to be **mounted** for the OS to be able to access its files
	- but where is the OS itself?


## Multi-FS 


## Booting
Process that happens to turn a computer on  
- Motherboard firmware (“BIOS”) in charge  
	- looks for clues on what it needs to start OS  
	- BIOS searches for a “boot block” that can start the system  
	- Has to set up devices to search them, but no drivers from OS yet. Not easy!  

- Disk contains Master Boot Record (MBR), suitable **boot block**  
	- When installing an OS on a new computer, boot block might come from CD or USB


## Boot block
At a fixed location on the disk (sector 0 usually)
- contains the boot loader
- contains the partition table

- Read by BIOS before even OS is even selected (ex : dual booting)
- BIOS gives control to boot loader
- Boot loader loads OS into RAM then gives it control

## Memory mapping
