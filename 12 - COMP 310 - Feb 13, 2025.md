## Main memory allocation
Sort of like a linked list that describes "regions" that are in use
- "holes" are regions NOT in use
- new processes need to go in "holes"

Free list : a list of the range of the physical memory NOT in use

### Which hole to pick?
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">First fit</mark>
	- take first hole bigger than requested
	- easier to find

- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Best-fit</mark>
	- take the smallest hole bigger than requested
	- leaves smallest hole behind

- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Worst-fit (?)</mark>
	- takes the largest hole


# External Fragmentation

Small holes become unusable, so we have a part of memory that we CAN'T use
- if this accumulates, then we have a serious problem

^ We cannot allocate a 20KB chunk even if we DO have 20KB free

## Exercise 
See slides 71 in lecture 6 !



# Context switch
![[Screenshot 2025-02-13 at 10.30.30 AM.webp]]

After the context switch, we change the base and bound registers
- we now have access to process B

- To start process A
	1. OS 
		- alloc entry in process table 
		- alloc memory for process
		- set base/bound registers
		- return from trap (into A)
	2. Hardware
		- restore registers of A 
		- move to user mode
		- jump to A's initial PC
	3. Program (user mode)
		- Process A runs 
		- fetch instruction
	4. Hardware
		- translate virtual address
		- perform fetch
	5. Program
		- execute instruction
	6. Hardware
		- if load/store:  
			- ensure address is legal  
			- translate virtual address  
			- perform load/store
	7. Program
		- A runs
	8. Hardware 
		- Timer interrupt  
			- move to kernel mode  
			- jump to handler
	9. OS 
		- Handler timer  
			- decide: stop A, run B  
			- save regs(A) including base and bounds to $PCB_A$  
			- restore regs(B) from $PCB_B$  
			- including base and bounds  
			- return from trap (into B)

# Internal fragmentation
A big chunk of "free space"
- "free" space takes up the physical memory, and it's inefficient
- this is called internal memory fragmentation

## Segmentation

Virtual address space
- two-dimensional
- set of segments 0 .. n
- each segment i is linear from 0 to MAX

Physical address space 
- Set of segments, each linear

### What is a segment?
Anything!
- could be either code, heaps, stacks, etc.

They allow for **non-continuous memory allocation**!

### Virtual address
Two-dimensional address contains : 
- segment number *s*
	- corresponding segment
- offset *d* within the segment
	- bits to add to the base number (of the corresponding segment)

> [!tip] Keep in mind!
> Segmentation **acts like multiple base-and-bound**s! But there are no internal fragmentation inside each segment


<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Example : </mark> 
![[Screenshot 2025-02-13 at 11.02.29 AM.webp]]
- according to the **segment table**, this address is a **heap address**!


## MMU for segmentation
We need a segment table!
- indexed by the segment number
- contains a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">(base, bound)</mark> pair
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">base</mark> : physical address of the segment in memory
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">bound</mark> : length of the segment

- If the segment table is in memory, rather than the MMU hardware, we need : 
	- pointer to table in memory
	- length of table

## Address translation example

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">physical address = offset in segment + segment base</mark>

### Questions to ask

1. how many bits does a virtual address have? What is the size of the virtual address space?

2. How many bits does a physical address have? What is the size of the physical address space?

3. What is the structure of the virtual address?
	- How many bits for the segment?  
	- How many bits for the offset?  
	- What is the maximum size of each segment? 

See slides 119 - 134 in lecture 6 for the example !!

# Sharing memory between processes

Why would we want this?
- run twice the same program in different processes
- may want to share code
- read twice the same file in different processes
- May want to share memory corresponding to file  

> [!Important] Notice that ...
> Sharing not possible with base and bounds, but is **possible with segmentation**  


## Sharing memory with segmentation

![[Screenshot 2025-02-13 at 11.23.04 AM.webp|581]]

We create a segment for the shared data (green)
- add segment entry in the segment table of both processes
- it points to the shared address in memory

We can also precise **read, write, and execute permissions** with a few more bits in the segment!
