# Sharing memory with segmentation
As seen in the [[12 - COMP 310 - Feb 13, 2025|previous class]] why would we share memory between processes?

Why would sharing memory be a bad thing?
- we're taking away precious memory that could be used for other things
- the performance would be atrocious

## Main memory allocation

> [!Important] Reminder !
> - Segmentation ~ multiple base-and-bounds
> - No internal fragmentation inside each segment

We need each segment to start small and then grow if necessary ==> using compaction!

## Compaction

> [!definition] Compaction
> Rearrange segments in physical memory to get rid of "holes"

- Stop running process
	- Slow!
- Copy data somewhere
	- Expensive!
- Change segment register value

It's very expensive if we want to grow a segment after

- Keep in mind that the allocator is **4-byte aligned**, meaning if we want to do `P1 = alloc(9)` , then we would need to round up to `12` bytes (next multiple of 4)
	- in other words : `P1 = alloc(9)  <==>  P1 = alloc(12)`

What could be the **advantages of aligned allocation**?
- We've over-allocated, but somehow, we have fewer failures. 
- Since we're allocating more blocks, whenever we free them, it's more likely that something else can fit in those newer "free" blocks
- We also know that the holes are **never** going to be smaller than 4 bytes

# Paging

> [!warning] Keep in mind!
> This concept is **EXTREMELY** important


- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Page</mark> : fixed-size portion of Virtual Memory (VM)
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Frame</mark> : fixed-size portion of physical memory (PM)
	- usually also called "page frame"

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Page size = frame size</mark>
- Typical size = 4KB
	- 8KB sometimes also, but always a power of 2

## How memory is divided

### Virtual address space
- linear from 0 up to a multiple of the page size

- two components in the <mark style="background: #5698FF9E;">virtual address</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #5698FF9E;">VPN</mark> : virtual page number
		- number of pages = (2)$^{VPN}$
	- <mark style="background: #5698FF9E;">Offset</mark> : offset within the page ; size of each page = (2)$^{offset}$

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Example : </mark>
- Virtual address 21 (010101)
- 2 VPN bits : 01
	- Number of pages = $2^2$ = 4 pages
- 4 offset bits : 0101
	- Page size = $2^4$ = 16B

### Physical address space
- noncontiguous set of frames, one per page

---

# MMU - Page table

> [!definition] Page table
> A data structure that maps the virtual address to the physical address

- indexed by page number
- contains frame number of page in memory
- **each process has a page table**

The **MMU** also needs :
- **pointer** to the page table in memory
- **length** of the page table

The **OS** also needs :
- **Reverse mapping** of the frame numbers to which pages they hold for which proceses

## ...they can get large 
- 32 bit address space + 4KB pages = 20 bits for VPN
	- 4MB = 2^20 entries * 4-B per page table entry

- 64-bit address space + 4-KB pages = 52 bits for VPN  
	- Petabyte scale = 252 entries âˆ— 8B per page table entry

However, the address space is sparsely used! We can solve this problem

## Valid / Invalid bit

We should add a valid bit in each page table entry
- 1 : if the portion of address space is used 
- 0 : otherwise

Some pages might be "swapped"
- They're used but not currently in RAM!
- We call these invalid/absent : 0 bit


## Multi-level page tables

> [!definition] Multi-level page tables
> Page table entries that **point to OTHER page tables**!

- we need fewer page table entries per table!
- If the outer level bit is invalid, it means that the next level table doesn't exist
- We're saving a LOT of space!

# Main memory allocation with paging

If we have a new process : 
- we have to find frames for all the process' pages

## Internal fragmentation 
With paging, an address space = multiple of the page size

However, part of one page of each region (code, stack, heap) may be unused
- this is not really a big problem if the page size is reasonable
