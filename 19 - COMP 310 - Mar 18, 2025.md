# File system role

As seen [[18 - COMP 310 - Mar 13, 2025 |last class]] : the main task of the file system is to translate from
- user interface --> disk interface
	- user interface : `Read(uid, buffer, bytes)`
	- disk interface : `ReadSector(logical_sector_number, buffer)`

---
# File system implementation
There are two key aspects of the system : 
1. Data structures
	- on disk 
	- in memory
2. Access methods
	- how do we `open()`, `read()` or `write()` ?

## In disk vs. in memory 

> [!Important] Golden rules!
> - if it's NOT on the disk and we crash, then the data structure is **GONE**!
> - if we need it after a crash, then it **MUST be on the disk**


# Disk data structures
<mark style="background: #007DFF61;">Data region</mark> -> occupies the most space in FS
- user data
- free space

<mark style="background: #007DFF61;">Metadata</mark>
- inodes
- free space management
- superblock

## Simple example
- A disk with <mark style="background: #FF7DC391;">64 blocks</mark> (very few) and <mark style="background: #FF7DC391;">4KB block size</mark> 

- we want a translation between FS interface to disk interface
	- we need some structure to map files to disk blocks!
	- recall when we mapped virtual to physical memory!

- Data region contains user data (<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">grey</mark>) and free space
	- how do we track files / free space?

## <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Inodes</mark>

Short for "<mark style="background: #007DFF61;">index node</mark>" --> used to **track files**
- responsible for tracking metadata for **one particular file**
	- type (file or dir)
	- uid (owner)
	- rwx (permissions)
	- size (in bytes)
	- blocks occupied by the file <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">--> important later</mark>
	- timing information (creation / last access time)
	- links_count (num. of paths aka hard links)

We should reserve an **inode tabl**e to track the files ! 
- <mark style="background: #007DFF61;">Inode table</mark> : holds an array of on-disk inodes
- inodes are not too large (<mark style="background: #FF7DC391;">128 -> 256 bytes per inode</mark>)

### How many inodes?
**Problem :** 
Assuming <mark style="background: #FF7DC391;">256-B per inode</mark>, how many inodes in our file system with <mark style="background: #FF7DC391;">4-KB blocks</mark>, knowing we used <mark style="background: #FF7DC391;">5 blocks</mark> ?

**Solving :**
- 4 KB = 4096 B
- 4096 / 256 = 16 inodes per block
- 16 * 5 blocks = <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">80 inodes in total</mark> in the FS

The inode blocks look like this :

## <mark style="background: #007DFF61;">Bitmaps</mark>
How can we keep track of the free space?

- <mark style="background: #007DFF61;">Free-lists</mark> (from memory management module)

- <mark style="background: #007DFF61;">Bitmaps</mark>
	- data structure where each bit indicates whether the corresponding object is free or not
	- 1 : in use
	- 0 : free

We will use (2) bitmaps!
- **data** bitmap
- **inode** bitmap

![[Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 10.47.26 AM.webp]]

### Bitmap capacity?
**Problem :** 
Assuming we use one 4KB block per bitmap, how many inodes and data blocks can we track?

**Solving :** 
4096 bytes * 8 bits/byte = 32 768 bits in each bitmap

- we can thus track ~32K inodes and blocks 

---

## <mark style="background: #FFDF0080;">Superblock</mark>
There's one block left unassigned, this is the **superblock**!

The <mark style="background: #007DFF61;">superblock</mark> contains the file system metadata 
- num. of inodes / data blocks
- start of inodes table
- what kind of FS is this?

# User data allocation
Now that we have all blocks occupied, **how do we allocate files to blocks** + **how do we handle free space** ?

**Strategies :** 
- Contiguous
- Extent-based
- Linked list
- File-Allocation Tables (FAT)
- Indexed
- Multi-level Indexed

**Things to keep in mind :** 
- amt. of fragmentation (external and internal)
- ability to grow the file over time
- sequential access performance
- random access performance
	- `seek()` function in the interface
- metadata overhead
	- wasted space to persistently store the metadata

---

## Contiguous allocation
Similar to base + bounds (seen in [[12 - COMP 310 - Feb 13, 2025|memory allocation]])

- **Strategy :** allocates file data blocks contiguously on disk
- **Metadata :** starting block + size of file 
	- very good because we don't need to store much info

![[Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 10.59.52 AM.webp|622]]

- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Metadata overhead</mark> --> low!
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Random access</mark> --> simple!
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Sequential access</mark> --> very easy!
- <mark style="background: #FF000063;">Growing files</mark> --> hard!
	- we would need to move files if we expand too much
	- if the files are big, then this is expensive + time consuming
- <mark style="background: #FF000063;">Fragmentation</mark> --> high fragmentation!
	- internal fragmentation : 
		- how much space is there allocated for data that we CANNOT use for data
		- there's very small internal fragmentation because it's contiguous allocation
	- external fragmentation :
		- bad! there's usually many unusable holes

This strategy is <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">impractical</mark> :(

---

## Extent-based allocation
Very similar to segmentation in memory allocation!

**Strategy :** allocate multiple contiguous regions (<mark style="background: #007DFF61;">extents</mark>) per file
**Metadata :** array of extents (goes into inode), and each entry contains extent starting block and size

![[Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 11.07.27 AM.webp]]

- <mark style="background: #FF000063;">Metadata overhead</mark> --> can be really bad
	- we need a considerable amount of metadata
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Random access</mark> --> could be worse
	- harder because we need to traverse the array of extents + find the correct extent
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Sequential access</mark> --> pretty good
	- it's good but we need to jump over extents which might be slow (we use seek() -- which goes into the disk -- slow)
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Growing files</mark> --> easy!
	- we don't need to copy many things
- <mark style="background: #FFDF0080;">Fragmentation</mark> --> lower
	- lower external fragmentation

This strategy has been <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">common practice in Linux</mark> -> great!

---

## Linked-list allocation

**Strategy :** allocate linked-list of blocks
**Metadata :** location of the first block of the file + each block contains pointer to the next block

![[Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 11.17.40 AM.webp]]

- <mark style="background: #FF000063;">Metadata overhead</mark> --> subpar
	- wastes space on pointers in data blocks
- <mark style="background: #FF000063;">Random access</mark> --> terrible
	- the worst random access for any strategy
	- if we want to access the data at 100000th byte, we need to read the entire first block to get the pointer to the second, ... so on and so forth until you find the right block
	- **we have to read the entire file** to find the metadata
	- this gets even worse if the blocks aren't contiguous + in order
- <mark style="background: #FFDF0080;">Sequential access</mark> --> depends on the data layout
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Growing files</mark> --> easy!
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Fragmentation</mark> --> low overall!
	- no external fragmentation 
	- low internal fragmentation

This is a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">bad strategy overall</mark> :(
