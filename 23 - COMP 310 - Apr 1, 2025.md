# Approach 2 : Intentions log (cont.)
As seen [[22 - COMP 310 - Mar 27, 2025|last class]] : 

Reserve an area of disk for (intentions) log

> [!important] Keep in mind!
> The log is on the disk, NOT in memory

## `open()`
- write to cache
- write to log
- make in-memory inode point to the update in log

## What could go wrong?

> [!warning] !!!
> This is a question that could possibly appear <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">on the final </mark>

- If we accessed the FS before the OS, we could damage the environment
- We could inject the OS with malware
- Could load a separate OS that *looks* like the one that's supposed to be loaded, but it doesn't do the safety checks
	- This is the <mark style="background: #FF000063;">worst possible outcome</mark>

- We can **overwrite the entire RAM** (4 GB), and this is a problem because the system stack is inside of it. We have lost the return pointer (?)
	- This is called "<mark style="background: #007DFF61;">code execution</mark>", and once an attacker achieves this, you have no more control on the device

## How intentions logging works 

Intentions logging use space on the disk for the log *ALL* of the time
- if the system crashes, the log will still be on the disk when the system restarts

### Initial state

### `open()`
![[Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 10.40.36 AM.webp]]

### `write(block0)`

### `close()`
- write the old and new inode to log in one disk write
- copy updates from log to the original disk locations
	- *happens later, in the background*
	- ![[Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 10.44.22 AM.webp]]
- when all the updates are done, overwrite the inode with the new value
	- *happens later, in the background*
	- ![[Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 10.44.40 AM.webp]]
- remove all updates and the old and new inode from the log
	- *happens later, in the background*
	- ![[Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 10.44.52 AM.webp]]

### Crash recovery
- Start at the beginning of the log and search forward through the log
- for each new inode found : 
	- find and copy updates to their original location
	- when all updates are done, write to the new inode
	- remove updates, old inode, and the new inode from the log

### Bottom line
- if the new inode **IS IN** the log and we crash --> we have the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">new copy</mark>
- if the new inode **IS** **NOT** in the log and we crash --> we have the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">old copy</mark>

- we're using <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">MORE storage</mark> doing logging (compared to **shadow paging**) because we're keeping copies of the inodes
	- only while we have them on the log, because they'll be deleted after, unlike **shadow paging**

*Note :* the file system state refers to the new / old copy
- maybe both copies are on the disk, but one is garbage

# Intentions Log vs. Shadow Paging

- Counting the number of disk I/Os
	- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Shadow Paging</mark> 
		- number of writes : <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">2</mark> (one for data block and one for inode)
	- <mark style="background: #FF000063;">Intentions Log</mark>  
		- number of writes (if no crash): <mark style="background: #FF000063;">4</mark> 
			- new data -> log
			- pair of inodes -> log
			- copy old data 
			- copy new data
		- number of writes (if crashes): 6
			- new data -> log (+1)
			- pair of inodes -> log
			- read data block and pair of inodes (+2)
			- copy old data 
			- copy new data

- Counting the number of random disk I/Os
	- Shadow Paging : writes are <mark style="background: #FF000063;">random</mark>
		- shadow pages can and will be anywhere
	- Intentions Log : writes are <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">sequential</mark>

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Logging works better !</mark>
	- writes to log are sequential (no seeks -> no using the disk)
	- data blocks stay in place
	- good disk allocation stays
	- write from cache 
		- when cache replacement 
	- write from log to data 
		- when disk is idle
