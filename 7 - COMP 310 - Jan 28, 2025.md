What if (lec 3, slide 136) : 
- leave note B happens, then before the first if statement in thread B, leave note A happens
- neither of them checks whether or not there is milk
- <mark style="background: #FF373791;">milk is never bought</mark>
  

### Non-symmetric threading (correct solution)

- Alice waits until there’s no note B to check if there’s milk or not
- there is no scenario where either there’s no milk OR there’s too much milk

if **Alice leaves her note before Bob**, then : 
- Bob does NOT buy the milk (if statements are not entered)
- he removes his note
- while loop in A is exited, she then buys milk
  
If Bob leaves his note before : 
- Alice does nothing
- Bob goes buy milk
- Alice checks for milk so removes her note
  

#### Discussion

- Works but too complicated, even for a simple example like this!
- The threads are not symmetrical, which is bad if we want to introduce more threads
- While Alice is waiting, she’s <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">wasting CPU time</mark>, which is **BAD**


<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Modern computers/processors don’t process the orders in the same order as we have written them</mark>, but we obviously get the same result
- However, **this is a problem** for solving the milk problem! 
- When we join two threads and try to synchronize them, it’s very hard to know which instruction goes first
- it all falls apart 


### Peterson’s Algorithm
- this uses symmetrical threading!


## Disabling interrupts

Idea : implement locks in kernel mode
- we won’t need the “spinlock”
- Maintain a lock variable and impose mutual exclusion ONLY during operations on that variable

- each lock gets its own queue, and that queue is on the kernel (NOT on the lock)
- we disable and enable interrupts because we don’t want to be interrupted by a timer and move on to another process


### Enabling interrupts after going to sleep

How can we achieve that? With the scheduler
- Since interrupts are disabled when we call sleep()
- the next thread HAS to re-enable the interrupts
- when the sleeping thread wakes up, it returns to lock(), and re-enables the interrupts

## Web servers
It’s not always the case that there’s only one process per program.

- An example of a multiprocessor program : web server!

### When there are multiple requests :

This is bad, because we’re not using the CPU in a long time, how can we fix it?

  

### Multiprocess web server

We can turn the individual requests into processes and treat them as such!

### Amount of work on server per request

- Receive network packet
    
- Run listener process
    
- Create worker process is expensive
    
- Read file from disk
    
- Send network packet
    

  

How can we avoid creating processes per each request?

  

### Process pool

We start with a loop creating a lot of processes and we lock them

- they wait until they receive a message for them to start doing something
    
- now, instead of creating a worker process, we just send a message to them!
    

  
  

## Interprocess Communication (IPC)

- we can do this through message passing !
    


![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf-gp-73J5M0xZbBMDdORcr6OBBSPbl6KsTx0qhw8QpXlKX0QplTFM1XQdsOU8EMhn3x5-o07TOAp_Cy0o_4u7jgIDnM0VH7cVWO8G0IWSODb_MofBmo5Bx4b2gSBEYzjKda0cIZg?key=Zxp6pP08T8TVtKzeAa5ztYV_)

the listener process sends the message, and the worker process receives it!

  

## Message passing 

This is by value communication, NEVER by reference (no pointer that BOTH processes can see since they don’t share any data)

- the receiver cannot affect the message in sender bc they don’t share data
    

  

### Symmetric messaging

send(msg, to_pid)

receive(msg, from_pid)

- msg is typically a struct
    
- pids are process identifiers
    

  

### Asymmetric addressing

send(msg, pid)

pid = receive(msg)

- receive msg from ANY process
    
- returns the pid of the sender process
    

  

### Blocking or nonblocking receive
