# Transactions

> [!definition] Transaction
> A transaction is a sequence of operations that should be treated as a logical whole

They're **ACID** : 
- **A***tomic* : all or nothing
- **C***onsistent* : all updates are done correctly
- **I***solation* : each transaction behaves as if it's the only one executing in the system
- **D***urability* : once the OS commits a transaction, the transaction must persist in the system, despite crashes / loss of power

# `ext3`
- ext3 is a widely used journaling file system on Linux

- a <mark style="background: #007DFF61;">block group</mark> is like a FFS cylinder group!
	- they're a sets of contiguous sectors on a disk 

- we know all the info of the group blocks thanks to the <mark style="background: #007DFF61;">block descriptor</mark> 


## Redo Write-ahead logging
### Pre-crash
- for each high-level file operation (ex : `write()`) that modifies the file system, 
	- write blocks that would be updated into the journal
	- once they're ALL in the journal, commit the transaction
	- ext3 can now do the "in place" writes to the ACTUAL data + metadata blocks 

### Post-crash
- iterate through the journal, reading the data blocks in the committed transaction and then writing them in the corresponding location on the disk
- if there's a crash, then just restart the journal replay
- we can deallocate journal entries once they've been replayed

## Logging physical books
ext3 journals physical blocks
- Even if only part of a physical block is updated, ext3 records the entire enclosing block in the journal 
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Ex:</mark> To journal an update to an inode (e.g., to update a data block pointer and file size), ext3 writes the inode’s entire enclosing block to the journal (ext3 can use a block size of 1024, 2048, 4096, or 8192 bytes, but inodes are only 256 bytes large) 
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Ex:</mark> Even if only part of a data block is updated, ext3 logs the entire block

<mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Ex:</mark> Appending to a file requires three in-place writes 
	*(1)* inode must be updated with a new file size and a new data block pointer 
	*(2)* the data block bitmap must be updated to reflect a new block allocation 
	*(3)* the data block itself must be written


How should ext3 issue the writes to the journal? 
- One possible strategy is to: 
	*(1)* Issue the journal writes serially, waiting for write i to complete before issuing write i+1 
	*(2)* After the last journal write finishes, issue the checkpoint (i.e., issue the in-place writes) at some future moment 

- If a crash happens in the midst of (1), we’re fine 
	- During crash recovery, we’ll see a valid TxStart, but no valid TxEnd for the associated tid 
	- If the data block made it to the journal, we’ll have to discard it, but the file system will be consistent

The prior strategy works, but it’s **slow**, since the writes are serially issued, a faster strategy is to: 
	*(1)* issue all of the journal writes at once 
	*(2)* when they all complete, issue the checkpoint at some future moment 

<mark style="background: #FF000063;">Problem :</mark> the disk can reorder writes, which may cause havoc if a crash happens during (1)
- Remember that only sector-sized writes are atomic! • For example, suppose that all writes except the middle one complete . . .

![[Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 10.38.28 AM.png|424]]


### Actual strategy
The actual ext3 strategy is to: 
*(1)* Issue TxStart and everything up to (but not including) TxEnd 
*(2)* Once those writes have all completed, issue TxEnd 
*(3)* Once the TxEnd is persistent, the checkpoint can be issued at some future moment 

This protocol ensures that a valid-looking transaction is really composed of valid journal entries
- Note that a TxEnd record is essentially just a tid, so it fits inside a single sector and will be written atomically

Remember that the journal is finite-sized! 
- ext3 treats the journal like a circular buffer • In the background, ext3 deallocates journal transactions that have been checkpointed
- The journal has its own superblock which records the start and end of the valid region 
- After a checkpoint occurs, ext3 asynchronously updates the superblock to indicate the new start of the log

## Controlling what gets journaled
There are three modes :
1. **data** 
2. **ordered**
3. **writeback** (unordered ???)

### Data mode
![[Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 10.42.43 AM.png|273]]

- we might lose a write when the system crashes


### Ordered mode
Just don't journal the data
![[Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 10.43.43 AM.png|259]]


### Unordered mode
![[Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 10.46.04 AM.png|376]]

- if the system crashes, we can get the metadata changes, but we have no guarantees for the content of the files
	- maybe the file doesn't change, but the metadata does!
	- only guarantee -> the metadata remains consistent

---
## Summary

to make a file system update in ordered mode, ext3 does :
	*(1)* Issue an in-place write for the data 
	*(2)* Once those writes complete, update the journal with TxBegin and journal entries for the metadata 
	*(3)* Once those writes complete, issue a TxEnd 
	*(4)* Once that write completes, asynchronously checkpoint the metadata (i.e., write the in-place metadata) 
	*(5)* Once that write completes, asynchronously update the journal superblock to deallocate the associated transaction

# Redo vs. Undo logging

<mark style="background: #007DFF61;">Redo logging : </mark>
- starting a transaction 
	- update the journal with TxBegin and the new data (associated with X)
- once those writes complete, commit the transaction
	- update the journal with TxEnd
- once the transaction is committed, asynchronously perform the in-place updates

<mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Pros : </mark>
- a transaction can commit without the in-place updates being complete 
	- only the journal updates need to be complete
	- in-place updates may be to random places on the disk, whereas journal writes are sequential

<mark style="background: #FF000063;">Cons : </mark>
- the dirty blocks must be buffered in-memory until the transaction commits and all of the associated journal records have been flushed to the disk
	- buffering leads to increased memory pressure
	- ideally, it would be safe to flush a dirty block after the associated journal record has been written to disk (even if the transaction has not committed yet)


<mark style="background: #007DFF61;">Undo logging : </mark>
- starting a transaction : 
	- update the journal with TxBegin and instructions on how to undo the X's in-place updates
		- they might include the original on-disk values
- once those writes complete, asynchronously perform the in-place updates
- once those writes complete, commit the transaction
	- update the journal with TxEnd

<mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Pros : </mark>
- dirty buffer can be written in-place as soon as the corresponding journal entries have been written to disk
	- Useful if the file system is experiencing high memory pressure and needs to evict buffers


<mark style="background: #FF000063;">Cons : </mark>
- transaction cannot commit until all dirty blocks have been flushed to their in-place targets 
	- delaying a transaction’s commit might delay other transactions who want to read or write the associated data 
	- so, the file system has time pressure to issue those writes quickly, even if they would cause unfortunate seeking behaviour

---

# Redo + Undo Logging
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Goal : </mark>
- allow dirty buffers to be flushed at any time after their associated journal entries are written 
	- like undo logging
- allow a transaction to commit without its in-place updates being finished (as in redo logging)

# NTFS
- redo + undo logging
- 4KB block sizes
- keeps a file in the root directory
	- `$MFT` (master file table) contains the metadata for all files + directory
	- `$LogFile` : the journal
	- `$Bitmap` : allocation info for the blocks

## Operation Logging
...


## Example of crash recovery
- redoing ALL of the sub-operations in order
	- this is different from redo, where it's only the committed ones
