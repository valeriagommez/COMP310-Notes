A continuation of data allocation strategies as seen [[19 - COMP 310 - Mar 18, 2025|last class]] : 

# User data allocation (cont.)

## File-Allocation Tables (FAT)

- **Strategy :** keep links information for all files in a data structure on disk --> <mark style="background: #007DFF61;">file allocation table (FAT)</mark>
	- **Optimization :** the FAT can be cached in memory
- **Metadata :** Location of the first block of the file, and FAT itself
	- the value `-1` in the FAT tells us where the file ends *BUT* to know where it **starts**, we need to <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">keep the position of the first block for each file</mark>

*Note :* this implementation has a linked list FAT, but other data structures can be used too!

- <mark style="background: #FF000063;">Metadata overhead</mark> --> could be very bad
	- fixed for the whole FS
	- BUT large files consume more of the table 
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Random access</mark> --> better!
	- better than linked list **if FAT is cached in memory**
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Sequential access</mark> --> better!
	- better than linked list can be comparable to extent-based allocation (but NOT as good)!
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Growing files</mark> --> good!
	- same as linked list
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Fragmentation</mark> --> good!
	- same as linked list

## Indexed allocation

- **Strategy :** keep pointers to blocks of the file in an <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">index in the file's inode</mark>
	- there's a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">file size limit</mark> -- it caps at max. $n$ pointers
- **Metadata :** index (array of pointers) for each file

- <mark style="background: #FFDF0080;">Metadata overhead</mark> --> could be very bad
	- not bad for small files
	- if the file is bigger than $n$ data blocks -> problem
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Random access</mark> --> easy!
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Sequential access</mark> --> efficient
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Growing files</mark> --> easy!
	- however, BAD if larger than n blocks
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Fragmentation</mark> --> low!
	- no external fragmentation and low internal 

This is <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">common practice in SD cards!</mark>

## Indexed allocation with indirect blocks

- $n$ pointers in inode block
- first $m$ *(m < n)* point to the first $m$ data blocks
- blocks $m+1$ -> $n$ point to **indirect** **blocks**

> [!definition] Indirect blocks 
> They don't contain data, they <mark style="background: #007DFF61;">contain pointers</mark> to subsequent data blocks

*Note :* double indirect blocks are also possible

This has the same advantages as indexed allocation +
- possible to **extend to VERY large files**
- can also be **used with extents**
	- default file system (FS) on Linux -> ext4 does exactly this

# Practice (slide 73 -- lec 11)
Assume we have a disk with <mark style="background: #FF7DC391;">512-byte disk sectors</mark> and <mark style="background: #FF7DC391;">4-byte disk addresses</mark>. The file system uses :
- inodes with 12 direct block pointers,
- 1 indirect block pointer, 
- 1 double-indirect block pointer,  
- 1 triple-indirect block pointer. 

The block size is identical to the sector size of the disk.  

A user process opens a file of length 1GB, and issues read requests for the following blocks of this file: **210, 211, 8000, 10000, 0, 1, 2, 13**. 
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">What is the total number of disk sector accesses?</mark> 
- Explain your answer by <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">drawing a diagram</mark> illustrating which disk accesses occur.  

Assume that prior to the open, the inode of the file and the blocks belonging to the file are not in the cache, but that there is space in the cache to store all of them. 
You may also assume that there is no file system activity going on, other than the accesses to this particular file.

## Gathering information : 
- *"inodes with 12 direct block pointers"* => n = 12

![[Screenshot 2025-03-20 at 11.13.23 AM.webp]]

direct pointers : 0 -- 11
indirect pointers : 12 -- 139
double indirect pointers : 139 -- 267

**Block 210 :** 
- one access to indirect block (+1)
- one access to block of pointers (+1)
- one access to the data block (+1)
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">3 accesses total</mark>

**Block 211 :**
- one access to the data block (+1) 
	- only 1 because we have already loaded the previous indirect block + block of pointers
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">1 access total</mark>

**Block 8 000 :** 
- in double indirect region (less than 16 000 -- which corresponds to triple indirect)
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">2 accesses total</mark>

**Block 10 000 :** 
- the second pointer block is not cached from when we read 8000, as it was the case for reading 211 after 210
- <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">2 accesses total </mark>

... -> <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">see slide 82</mark>

# File systems

## Creating `foo/bar`
![[Screenshot 2025-03-20 at 11.24.23 AM.webp|720]]

Last step : 
- we did a write to `foo` and didn't update its metadata
	- we need to fix it! --> write to `foo inode`
