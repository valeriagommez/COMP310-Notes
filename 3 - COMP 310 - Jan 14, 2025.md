## Process vs Program

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Process</mark>  
- program that’s actually being executed
- usually represented by a file on a disk


<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Program</mark>  
- actual program / piece of code 
- usually represented in memory


## Process

a process can be viewed as an execution stream in the context of a process state
- execution stream : stream of executing instructions
- process state : everything that the running code can affect or be affected by 
- registers (not all of them), address space, heap, stack, code, open files
  

Process = Environment + Code

  

### What can processes do?

basically anything (shell, editor, compiler, browser, etc. are all processes)

  

### Process identification – pid

each process has an unique process identifier called “pid”

  

### pid = fork()

creates an identical copy of the parent

- the parent will now return the pid of the child created by THAT fork() call
	- the **child** returns pid = 0

  

### exec(filename)

loads executable from file with filename

- the current process ceases existing and is completely replaced by the process loaded by exec(...)
    

  

### wait()

waits for one of its children to terminate

  

### Terminating a process

- normal exit
- error
- terminated by another process



## Address space

made up of static and dynamic components

- static : code and some global variables

- dynamic : stack and the heap

### Dynamic allocation of memory

- useful for processes because we don’t know the amount of memory we need at the compile time

- if we allocate static memory, we must be very pessimistic and allocate a lot (in the worst case scenario)

- if we allocate statically enough for the worst possible case scenario, then we would be “wasting” storage / it would be very inefficient

  
### Stack

a pointer separates the allocated and the freed space in address space

- the stack is built from the ground up, so : 

- allocating space – alloc(x) : increment pointer

- freeing space – free(x) : decrement pointer


stack management is done automatically 


### Heap

allocates from any random location

- there might be random free areas (holes) in the heap

- if there are holes, then we call the heap “fragmented”

- space is wasted

- the order to allocate is free and unpredictable


- **pro** : works for all data structures
- **cons** : allocation can be slow, and we can encounter fragmentation

  

## Quiz (in slides)

- x : static data (global variable)
- main : code
- y : stack (local variable)
- z – POINTER : stack (local variable)
- z* – what the pointer is pointing at : heap (malloc is a heap function)

- Just because something is a pointer, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it will point to the heap 


## Linux Process Tree

### Boot – init

first process after boot is the “init” process

- usually, it’s the parent of the shell
    

  

Example process : 

1. user logs in
    
2. init forks (doesn’t wait)
    
3. child executes cell
    
4. user runs make
    
5. shell forks and waits
    
6. child executes make 
    
7. make runs cp
    
8. make forks and waits
    
9. child executes cp

- after a fork, the WHOLE process (environment + code) is duplicated
    

- the advantage is : the child automatically inherits the WHOLE environment 
    

- after an exec() in the child, the code is replaced by the new code

- yes! the code written could change the environment of child and we could keep the changes 
    

- ex : manipulate stdin and stdout
