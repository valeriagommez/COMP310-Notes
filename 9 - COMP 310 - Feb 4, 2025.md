# Basic approach to multithreading
1. divide work among multiple threads
2. share data

- which data is shared ?
	- global variables and heap

- where is shared data accessed?
	- put shared data access in critical sections


## Example of single threaded code

```c
main(){  
	int i  
	int sum = 0  
	int prod = 1  
	for (i = 0; i < MAX; ++i) {  
		c = a[i] * b[i]  
		sum += c  
		prod *= c  
	}  
}
```

- arrays are of length `MAX`
- `sum` ends up being the dot product of `a[i]` and `b[i]`
- `prod` ends up being the product of all the array elements


## Example with multiple threads

### Version 1 : 
```c
int sum, prod

main() {  
	int i  
	int sum= 0, prod = 1  
	for (i = 0; i < MAX_THREADS; i++) { Pthread_create(...) }  
	for (i = 0; i < MAX_THREADS; i++) { Pthread_join(...) }  
	printf(sum)  
	printf(prod)  
}

Threadcode() {  
	int i, c  
	for (i=my_min; i<my_max; i++) {  
		c = a[i] * b[i]  
		pthread_mutex_lock(biglock)
		sum += c  
		prod *=c  
		pthread_mutex_unlock(biglock)
	}  
}
```

- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Local data :</mark>
	- i
	- c
	- my_min
	- my_max

- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Shared read-only data : </mark>
	- a
	- b

- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Shared data : </mark>
	- sum
	- prod

- We want to protect the access to the shared data with `mutex`
	- this happens in `Threadcode()`
	- not necessarily in main() because only main thread accesses sum and prod

However, this is not really a good solution. **Why?**
- A single lock inhibits parallelism
- Two new approaches : 
	- Fine-grain locking
	- Privatization


# Fine grain locking

> [!Definition] Fine grain locking
> Multiple locks on individual pieces of shared data

## Example

We would make separate locks for sum and prod : 

```c
Threadcode() {  
	int i, c  
	for (i=my_min; i<my_max; i++) {  
		c = a[i] * b[i]  
		pthread_mutex_lock(sumlock)  
		sum += c  
		pthread_mutex_unlock(sumlock)  
		pthread_mutex_lock(prodlock)  
		prod *= c  
		pthread_mutex_unlock(prodlock)  
	}  
}
```



# Privatization

Make shared data accesses into private data accesses

## Example 

We define for each thread (outside of the loop) : 
- a local variable representing its sum
- a local variable representing its prod

Use those variables for accesses in the loop
- these become local accesses 
- there's NO more need for locks

We only access the shared data after the loop
- This is where we use the lock

```c
Threadcode() {  
	int i, c  
	local_sum = 0  
	local_prod = 1  
	
	for (i=my_min; i<my_max; i++) {  
		c = a[i] * b[i]  
		local_sum += c  
		local_prod *= c  
	}  
	
	pthread_mutex_lock(sumlock)  
	sum += local_sum  
	pthread_mutex_unlock(sumlock)  
	pthread_mutex_lock(prodlock)  
	prod *= local_prod  
	pthread_mutex_unlock(prodlock)  
}
```


# Comparing both methods

**Fine grain locking :** 
- 2 lock accesses PER thread PER 

**Privatization :** 
- 2 lock accesses PER thread TOTAL


# Producer/Consumer Problem
As seen in [[Producer-Consumer Problem]]

## Introduction
This problem arises when two or more threads communicate with eachother 
- some threads "produce" data 
- some threads "consume" this data

---

## I/O queues

Example of producer/consumer problem in OS : I/O queues

![[Screenshot 2025-02-04 at 10.48.51 AM.webp]]

- Multiple producer threads
- Multiple consumer threads
- One shared bounded buffer with N entries

### What if :

- producers try to add data when the buffer is full?
	- data is lost forever, some things won't make it to the buffer

- consumer tries to fetch something from the buffer when it's empty?
	- it ends up "fetching" some garbage data
	- it "hallucinates" data and could be doing something it's not supposed to do


### How to fix this :

Here's a list of requirements

1.  No production when all N entries are full
2.  No consumption when all entries are empty
3.  Access to the buffer is mutually exclusive?
4.  To avoid busy waiting, any user that successfully accesses the buffer MUST produce/consume successfully


### Solving with locks (incorrect)

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Problem 1 :</mark>
- the buffer is full and the producer wants to add entries

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Problem 2 :</mark>
- the buffer is empty and the consumer wants to consume


### Solving with semaphores
Semaphores (as seen in [[6 - COMP 310 - Jan 23, 2025]]) are the solution!

We use :
1. circular buffer, 
2. a single producer thread, 
3. a single consumer thread

- 1 semaphore counts the number of FREE spaces --> emptyBuffer
	- it's initialized to N

- 1 semaphore counts the number of EMPTY spaces --> fullBuffer
	- it's initialized to 0

#### Producer code
```c
i = 0; 

while (1) {  
	wait(&emptyBuffer);  
	Fill(&buffer[i]);  
	i = (i+1)%N;  
	post(&fullBuffer);  
}
```

4. wait until a slot is ready to be filled
5. fill that
6. update the index


#### Consumer code
```c
j = 0;  

while (1) {  
	wait(&fullBuffer);  
	Use(&buffer[j]);  
	j = (j+1)%N;  
	post(&emptyBuffer);  
}
```

7. wait until something is available
8. use that 
9. update the index

---

## Multiple producers/consumers

The code above will NOT work : 

- i and j are private or public? If there are more than one, they need to be able to see the same value
	- let's get rid of them

- We have multiple producer/consumer threads now
	- so we also need a lock
	- however, there's a deadlock at mutex
		- <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">ex :</mark> if consumer runs first, it will never release mutex
	- We should thus lock AFTER the wait function and NOT BEFORE


### Producer code
```c
while (1) {  
	wait(&emptyBuffer); 
	lock(&mutex);
	myi = findempty(&buffer); 
	Fill(&buffer[i]);  
	i = (i+1)%N;  
	post(&fullBuffer);  
	unlock(&mutex);
}
```


### Consumer code
```c
while (1) {  
	wait(&fullBuffer); 
	lock(&mutex);
	myj = findfull(&buffer); 
	Use(&buffer[j]);  
	j = (j+1)%N;  
	post(&emptyBuffer);  
	unlock(&mutex);
}
```


This works !
- However, it limits concurrency. 
- Only 1 thread at a time can be using or filling different buffers

- it considers possible locations for mutual exclusion
	- equivalent to a semaphore initialized to 1
