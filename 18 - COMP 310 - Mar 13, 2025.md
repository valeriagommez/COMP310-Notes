# Hard vs Soft links
Assuming mapping (string1, uid) already exists : 

## <mark style="background: #5698FF9E;">Hard links</mark> : 
After HardLink, two mappings are <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">equivalent</mark>!

```c
HardLink(string2, uid)
Remove(string1, uid)
```
- Mapping ( string2, uid ) remains


## <mark style="background: #5698FF9E;">Soft links</mark> : 
After SoftLink, the two mappings are <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">different</mark>!

```c
SoftLink(string2, string1)
Remove(string1, uid)
```
- Mapping ( string2, string1) is a dangling reference

## Quiz - Slide 68 (lec 10)
Describe the result of each of the two Open()s, and explain your answer : 

Create( name1 )  
HardLink( name2, name1 )  
SoftLink( name3, name2 )  
SoftLink( name4, name2 )  
HardLink( name5, name3 )  
Delete( name3 )  
Open( name5 )  <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">--> opens the file</mark>
Delete( name2 )  
Open( name4 ) <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">--> is a dangling reference</mark>

## Disk terminology

### Mechanical terms : 
![[Screenshot 2025-03-13 at 10.34.15 AM.webp]]
- read/write heads : position the platters in the right place


### Information terms

![[Screenshot 2025-03-13 at 10.35.06 AM.webp]]


- we divide each surface (co-centric rings / <mark style="background: #5698FF9E;">tracks</mark>) up into numbered sectors
	- a stack of tracks (across platters) is called a cylinder

![[Screenshot 2025-03-13 at 10.39.56 AM.webp|311]]

- we can read from each surface using the head on an arm while the spindle/platter rapidly spins (like a vinyl)
- We have to make sure that the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">angular velocity / density of the disk is the same</mark> such that it's even


## Disk interface
We can access only by sectors : 
```c
ReadSector ( logical_sector_number, buffer )  
WriteSector( logical_sector_number, buffer )
```

The `logical_sector_number` can be stored as having the following fields : 
1. Platter
2. Cylinder of track
3. Sector 


# File system implementation

The main task of the file system is to translate from :
- user interface --> disk interface
	- user interface : `Read(uid, buffer, bytes)`
	- disk interface : `ReadSector(logical_sector_number, buffer)`

## Simplifications

1. User Read() allows arbitrarily number of bytes
	- Simplify to only allowing Read() of a (fixed-size) block
	- Read(uid, block_number)

2. Typically <mark style="background: #FF7DC391;">block_size = 2^n * sector_size</mark>
	- **Often**: 
		- Block size = 4,096 bytes, 
		- Sector size = 512 bytes  
	- For simplicity of presentation in class : <mark style="background: #FF7DC391;">block_size = sector_size</mark>


# Accessing a disk 

1. **Head selection**
	- select platter
2. **Seek** 
	- move arm over cylinder
3. **Rotational latency**
	- move head over wanted sector
4. **Data transfer time**
	- read from the sector

## 1. Head selection
- electronic switch
- ~ nanoseconds

## 2. Seek Time
- approx. linear in the number of cylinders
- 3 -> 12 milliseconds

## 3. Rotational latency
- linear in number of sectors
- rotational speed : 4500 -> 15 000 RPM
- one revolution : 1 / (RPM/60) sec
- Avg. rotational latency = ½ revolution  
- From 2 -> 7.1 milliseconds

## 4. Data transfer time
- Effective transfer rate ~ 1 Gbyte per second  
- <mark style="background: #FF7DC391;">Sector = 512 bytes</mark>  
- Transfer time ~ 0.5 microseconds


## Quiz - Slide 126 (lec 10)

Consider a disk with : 
- a sector size of 512 bytes, 
- 1,000 tracks per surface, 
- 100 sectors per track, 
- 5 double-sided platters, 
- a block size of 2,048 bytes

- Suppose that the average *seek time* is 10ms, the average *rotational delay* is 5 ms, and the *transfer rate* is 200 MB per second. 
- Suppose that a file containing *1,000,000 records of 100 bytes* each is to be stored on such a disk and that no record is allowed to span two blocks.  

1. How many blocks are required to store the entire file?  
	-  We need 50 000 blocks to store the entire file
	- SEE SLIDES


2. If the file is arranged sequentially on disk, how many cylinders are needed?  


3. What is the time required to read the file sequentially?
	- Pick the right head -> seek to the correct track
	- Transfer time = ?
		- (50 000 * 2^11 B) / (200 * 2^20 B/s) = 0.488 s => <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">488 ms</mark>
	- Total read time = ?
		- 10 + 5 + 488 = <mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">503 ms</mark> 


# File system cache (Buffer cache)
- To optimize disk access : 

## Rule 1 : don't access the disk! Use a cache :

- What ?
	- keep recently accessed blocks in memory
- Why ?
	- reduce latency 
	- reduce disk load
- How ?
	- reserve kernel memory for cache
	- cache entries : file blocks (of block size)

## Reading with a cache
- if in the cache 
	- return the data from the cache
- else 
	- find a free cache slot
	- initiate disk read 
	- when disk read completes, return the data

## Writing with a cache
ALWAYS write in cache

- How does it get to the disk?
	- <mark style="background: #5698FF9E;">Write-through</mark>
		- write to cache
		- write to disk
		- return to user
	- <mark style="background: #5698FF9E;">Write-behind</mark>
		- write to cache
		- return to user
		- later -> write to disk

### Write-through vs write-behind
- Response time 
	- **write-behind** is much better
- Disk load 
	- **write-behind** is much better
	- much data is overwritten before it gets to the disk
- Crash 
	- **write-through** is much better
	- no "window of vulnerability"

In practice, we use write-behind 
- Periodic cache flush  
- User primitive to flush data

# Rule 2 : don't wait for the disk, read ahead

## Read-Ahead
What?  
• User request for block i of a file  
• Also read block i+1 from disk  

Why?  
• No disk I/O on (expected) user access to block i+1  

How?  
• Put block i+1 in the buffer cache  

--> Remember: Pre-paging uses read-ahead if neighboring virtual pages are also neighbors in physical memory.

Works for sequential access  
• Most access is sequential  
• In Linux it is the default

## Caveat 
Does not reduce number of disk I/Os  
• In fact, could increase them (if not sequential)  
• In practice, very often a win  
• Linux always reads one block ahead


# Rule 3 : Minimize seeks 
Can do this by :
- clever disk allocation
- clever scheduling

## Clever disk allocation
- Idea:  
	- Locate related data (same file) on same cylinder  
	- Allocate “**related**” blocks “**together**”

- **Related** : 
	- Consecutive blocks in the same file  
	- Sequential access

- **Together** : 
	- On the same cylinder  
	- On a nearby cylinder

## Clever disk scheduling
- Idea: Reorder requests to seek as little as possible  

Different disk scheduling policies:  
• FCFS – First-Come-First-Served  
• SSTF – Shortest-Seek-Time-First  
• SCAN  
• C-SCAN  
• LOOK  
• C-LOOK

### FCFS
