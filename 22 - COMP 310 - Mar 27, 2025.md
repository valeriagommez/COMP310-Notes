# Memory mapping

- `mmap()`
	- maps the contents of the file in memory
- `munmap()`
	- remove the mapping

As seen in a typical virtual address space (VMEM) :

## Accessing mmap()-ed files
Accessing the mmap()-ed memory region can :
- cause a page fault
- cause page / block of tile to be brought in
	- "Backing store" for that address is the file, and not the VMEM backing store

---

# `mmap()` implementation
- on mmap()
	- allocate page table entries
	- set valid bit to "invalid"

- on access 
	- page fault
	- file = backing store for the mapped region of memory
	- just like in demand paging
	- except paged from mapped file

- after page fault handling
	- set valid bit to true


## How to get data to disk for `mmap()
- through normal page replacement
- or through an explicit call `msync()`


## What is `mmap()` good for?
- it's good for random access to a large file
	- like data bases, which we don't really care about reading sequentially

### Random access with ...
`mmap()`
- addr = mmap()
- use memory addresses in \[addr, addr + len - 1]

`read()`
- open
- read entire file to memory buffer
- then use the memory address in buffer

`seek()`
- open
- seek 
- read into buffer

### Advantage with `mmap()`
- much easier programming model
	- follow pointer in memory
	- as opposed to (seek, read) every time

- easier if reusing a block
	- VM system keeps the page for you
	- otherwise, you need to do your own replacement

<mark style="background: #76DD90A8;">Pros : </mark>
- easy to write
- only bring in memory what you need
- easy reuse
- mapping the same file twice causes page sharing
	- could be helpful in some cases

<mark style="background: #FF000063;">Cons : </mark>
- alignment on page boundary
- not easy to extend a file
- for small files : 
	- `read()` is more efficient than `mmap()` + page fault
- mapping the same file twice causes page sharing
	- can be extremely confusing

# Dealing with crashes
ex :
```c
fd = Open( file )  
Write( fd, 0 )  
Write( fd, 1 )  
Write( fd, 2 )  
Write( fd, 3 )  
Close( fd )  
```

- If we crash after line 1 or 5, there's no problem 

- BUT if we *crash at line 3*, then we encounter a problem
	- we have **half of the old** and **half of the new** file

- If we have a cache, and we *crash after line 6*, we might still have a problem
	- the blocks might not be written yet OR the inodes have not been written yet either

# Atomicity

> [!definition] Definition
> <mark style="background: #007DFF61;">Atomicity</mark> means one uninterruptible operation. For a file system, it means : 
> - **All or Nothing**
> - all updates are on the disk OR no updates are on the disk (there's no in-between)

## How to implement atomicity
How do we make sure that ALL or NO updates to an open file get to the disk?
- Assume that a single disk sector write is atomic :
	- ![[Screenshot 2025-03-27 at 10.50.30 AM.webp|450]]
	- With a very high probability -- disk vendors work very hard for this

- Approach 1: **Shadow Paging**  
- Approach 2: **Intentions Log**

# Approach 1 : Shadow paging
- make sure you have old copy on disk and the new copy too
- switch **atomically** between the two
	- how do we switch atomically? --> by doing a `WriteSector()` !

## How this works (Write-through)

`open()`
- read inode into active file table (AFT)

`write()`
- allocate **new** blocks on disk for data
- fill in address of new blocks in **in-memory copy** of inode
- write data blocks to cache and disk

`close()`
- overwrite **in-memory copy** of inode to the disk inode
	- write it atomically

## How this works (Write-behind)
`open()`
- read inode into active file table (AFT)

`write()`
- allocate **new** blocks on disk for data
- write disk addresses to **in-memory copy** of inode
- write data blocks to cache (don't have to write to the disk yet)

`close()`
- write all the cached blocks to new disk blocks
- write in-memory inode (containing all new block addresses) to disk

*Note :* inode write is atomic --> FS on disk state is always consistent

### What happens to the old blocks ?
- de-allocate them
- if the crash happens before the de-allocate, the file system check will find them

---

## Approach 2 : Intentions log

Reserve an area of disk for (intentions) log

> [!important] Keep in mind!
> The log is on the disk, NOT in memory

`open()`
- write to cache
- write to log
- make in-memory inode point to the update in log
